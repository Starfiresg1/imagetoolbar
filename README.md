Image Toolbar
=============
Image Toolbar is a clone of one of Internet Explorer's features and provides quick and easy access to a handful of image functions in a highly customisable way.

The toolbar is activated by hovering your mouse cursor over an image. It will be displayed (by default) in the top left hand corner of the image, and allows you to save the image or perform other functions. 

Details
-------
Image Toolbar provides the following buttons...

 - Save - You can set this to either prompt you to save or to automatically save to a previously chosen directory.
 - Copy - Copies the image and the image location, allowing you to paste a link or the full image into most software packages.
 - Print - Lets you print preview or directly print the current image.
 - Info - Launches a dialog detailing the image properties.
 - Folder - This allows you to open your designated image folder quickly or change it to another folder.

Ctrl-clicking or middle-clicking will activate each button's secondary function, for example, to switch between launching a save prompt and silently downloading to the default location. 

Installation
------------
Drag and drop the latest XPI file from the build folder into a Firefox window. Alternatively, you can install the extension from:

 - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-toolbar/
